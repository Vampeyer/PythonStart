Arithmetic Operators

The expression 2 + 3 + 7 uses the arithmetic operator +

Other operators we may use in Python expressions are:

  -     the minus operator

  *    the multiplication operator

  /     the division operator

  //   another division operator (what’s the difference?

  %   the mod operator (remaindering operator)

  **  the exponentiation operator

Scripts Involving Arithmetic Expressions

Consider the screenshot shown below

Each expression typed leads to the result shown on the line below it
Note that 8 / 3 yields a result with the decimal part and 8 // 3 yields an integer result
Also, 8 / 2 yields 4.0 as opposed to 4 because of / as opposed to //
13 % 5 yields the remainder when 13 is divided by 5
2**3 calculates 23 (Exponentiation) [Python uses ^ for something else]

Data Types and Values

A value is a letter, number, or a string

2, 2.466, ‘Hello Python!’ are examples of values

Each value is of a specific data type

2 is an integer (int)
2.466 is a floating-point number (float)
‘Hello Python!’ is a string (str)
The term “class” is used by Python to identify the category of data being defined by the value.
