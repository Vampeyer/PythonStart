    "By the time you attempt this lab, you should have completed the *Strings* section in your **Coding Learning Module**. The problems in this lab will apply the concepts and skills you've learned up to this point. Let's start with a refresher. In Python, strings are made up of characters stored sequentially, each of which has a numeric value associated with it. Historically, there have been many systems developed that use simple integer values to represent each unique character in an alphabet. Currently, the most popular system is named <a href =\"https://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Unicode</a> (click the link to learn more about this history). Simply put, Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter the platform, no matter the program, no matter the language being written - English, Greek, Russian, it doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem in the lab asks you to create a table that shows each uppercase letter of the English alphabet (A-Z) and that character's associated Unicode number. As you may recall, Python has a function that can be used to look up a given character's Unicode value (`ord` - see <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#ord\" target=\"_blank\">Python documentation for `ord`</a>). Similarly, if you have a Unicode number, Python has a function that can be used to return that number's associated string character (`chr` - see <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr\" target=\"_blank\">Python documentation for `chr`</a>).\n",

    "The next problem is **optional** but applies more of the concepts and skills that you have learned up to this point. It requires that you do some manipulation on a user-entered string to change all the letters to the same case (upper case or lower case) and remove any non-alphabetic characters (or, more accurately, *include* only alphabetic characters). Once this is done, the string will be tested to see if it is a _palindrome_ (a word or phrase that is the same when read both forward and backward).\n",

    "If you want your test for a palindrome to be flexible, it should ignore all non-alphbetic characters included in the phrase when comparing the characters in forward and backward direction.

This method and others like it that begin with the word \"*is*\" normally return a Boolean result, **True** or **False**, and can easily be used in an **if** statement.

A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same when read both forward and backward. For example, __BOB__ is a palindrome but __ALICE__ is not.
