#Python Lists
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Create a List:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

"""
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

Example
Lists allow duplicate values:
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
"""List Length
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

Example
Print the number of items in the list: , or the Length  
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))




"""
List Items - Data Types
List items can be of any data type:

Example
String, int and boolean data types:
"""
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]
#A list can contain different data types:
'''
Example
A list with strings, integers and boolean values:
'''
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

#From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':


#What is the data type of a list?

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))
