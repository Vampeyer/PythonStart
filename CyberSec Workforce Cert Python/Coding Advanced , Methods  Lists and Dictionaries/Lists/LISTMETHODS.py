bullet
append adds a single item onto the end of a list


bullet
extend adds a sequence of items onto the end of a list


bullet
insert adds a new item into a list at a specified index, shifting existing elements to accommodate the new item
'''
admissions = [12, 15, 9]
print(admissions)
 
admissions.append(14)
print(admissions)
#[12, 15, 9, 14]
admissions.insert(0, 13)
print(admissions)
#[13, 12, 15, 9, 14]
weekend_admissions = [16, 10]
admissions.extend(weekend_admissions)
print(admissions)
#[13, 12, 15, 9, 14, 16, 10]

List Methods

List method sort rearranges the elements of the list from low to
 highâ€¢You may add the optional keyword argument reverse=True to go from high
 to low instead

#Numbered Indexed Array indexing and assignment
admissions = [124, 115, 102, 107, 99, 96, 88]
 
thesecondindex = admissions[2]
print(thesecondindex)



#What is returned here?  

room_numbers = [101, 102, 103, 104] 
room_numbers + [105] # =  [101, 102, 103, 104, 105]
