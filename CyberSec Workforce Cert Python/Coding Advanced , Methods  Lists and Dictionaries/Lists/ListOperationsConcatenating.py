List Operations

As with strings, the + operator concatenates lists and the * operator repeats a list a given number of times

EXAMPLE:
'''
east_rooms = [101, 102, 103, 104]
west_rooms = [105, 106, 107, 108]
all_rooms = east_rooms + west_rooms
print(all_rooms)
[101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]
