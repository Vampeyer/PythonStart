'''
Traversing a List
The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is with a for loop

The syntax is the same as for strings:
'''
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
for num in numbers:
        print(num, end=' ') 
'''

10 20 30 40
This works well if you only need to read the elements of the list but if you want to write or update the elements, you need to use the indices.

A common way to do that is to combine the built-in functions range and len: 
'''
for i in range(len(numbers)):
        numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
print(numbers)
#[20, 40, 60, 80]
#This loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of elements in the list. range returns a list of indices from 0 to nâˆ’1, where n is the length of the list. Each time through the loop i gets the index of the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the new value. 

#A for loop over an empty list never runs the body.
