Traversal with a for loop using indices

You can easily loop through the indices associated with the characters of a string using a for loop and the range function

For example, the following code fragment prints each character of the string on a separate line

>>> s = 'Hello'
>>> for index in range(len(s)):
>>>    print(s[index])
H
e
l
l
o
