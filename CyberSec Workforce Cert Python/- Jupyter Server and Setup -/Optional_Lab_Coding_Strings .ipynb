        "By the time you attempt this lab, you should have completed the *Strings* section in your **Coding Learning Module**. The problems in this lab will apply the concepts and skills you've learned up to this point. Let's start with a refresher. In Python, strings are made up of characters stored sequentially, each of which has a numeric value associated with it. Historically, there have been many systems developed that use simple integer values to represent each unique character in an alphabet. Currently, the most popular system is named <a href =\"https://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html\" target=\"_blank\">Unicode</a> (click the link to learn more about this history). Simply put, Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter the platform, no matter the program, no matter the language being written - English, Greek, Russian, it doesn't matter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first problem in the lab asks you to create a table that shows each uppercase letter of the English alphabet (A-Z) and that character's associated Unicode number.

Similarly, if you have a Unicode number, Python has a function that can be used to return that number's associated string character (`chr` - see <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr\" target=\"_blank\">Python documentation for `chr`</a>).\n",
