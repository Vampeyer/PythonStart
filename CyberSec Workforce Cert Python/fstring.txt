Example -  Consider the following example, solved with and without an f-string:

>>> name = 'Mary'
>>> age = 37
>>> print(name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old.')
Mary is 37 years old.

>>> print(f'{name} is {age} years old.')
Mary is 37 years old.
Note how the f-string avoids the need to concatenate the string and use the string constructor to convert the numeric variable to a string when printing
