Traversal with a for loop not using indices

A for loop can also be used to directly traverse the characters in a string without specifying the indices needed

Since all strings start at index [0] and all know their own length, it isn't necessary to specify these when traversing a string with a for loop
EXAMPLE: the following code fragment prints each character of the string on a separate line without specifying any indices

>>>   s = 'Hello'
>>>  for letter in s:
          print(letter)
H
e
l
l
o
