Slicing with Steps

As with the range function, slices can also use a step argument to determine which indices are used when making its copy.

EXAMPLE: the following code copies every other letter by using a step size of 2:

>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[0:5:2]
'bnn'
Similarly, a step size of -1 will create a copy in reverse order:

>>> fruit = 'banana'
>>> fruit[::-1]
'ananab'
