String methods that search for substrings



You may need to search a string to see if it contains a particular sequence of characters, known as substring, or at which index the substring begins, or even how many times a substring may occur.  Python provides methods (or operators) for each of these scenarios



The simplest search for a substring is simply to find out if it is present in the tested string â€“ Python's in operator does this.  



The keyword in is a boolean operator that takes two strings and returns True if the first appears as a substring in the second and False otherwise:


 >>> 'a' in 'banana'

True

>>> 'seed' in 'banana'

False



See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-common



Note: not in returns the opposite of in



To find the first index in a string where a specified substring may be found, use Python's string method find

If the substring is not present, the method will return -1
In addition to specifying the substring to be found, the method can also accept start and end indices that will limit the search to the [start:end] slice of the string
EXAMPLE:

>>> s = 'banana'
>>> s.find('an')
1
>>> s.find('na')
2
>>> s.find('ab')
-1
>>> s.find('an',2,6)
 3



See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.find



Method index works just as find except when the substring is not present, it produces a ValueError instead of simply returning -1.  Methods rfind and rindex work 



To count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring in a string, use Python's string method count

If the substring is not present, the method will return 0
In addition to specifying the substring to be counted, the method can also accept start and end indices that will limit the search to the [start:end] slice of the string
EXAMPLE:

>>> s = 'banana'
>>> s.count('an')
2
>>> s.count('ana')
1
>>> s.count('ab')
 0



See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.count

Note: In this example, s.count('ana') returns 1 because the 'ana' at the end of 'banana' overlaps the first occurrence and count only considers non-overlapping occurrences.

For integer values, the d presentation type may be used to format values

The presentation types b, o, x or X can be used to format integer output using binary, octal, and hexadecimal number systems

Consider formatting an inventory report:

>>> part = 'Hammer'
>>> quantity = 10
>>> price = 11.5
>>> print(f'{part:10} : {quantity:3d} @ ${price:.2f}')
Hammer     :  10 @ $11.50
