String Formatting

Python provides several ways to create strings that precisely control the appearance of values
 of variables and expressions being printed.  Since Python 3.6, the preferred way to perform such 
 formatting of output is with formatted string literals or f-strings

An f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with the letter f and contains replacement 
fields delimited by curly braces {}

Variables and expressions inside the curly braces will be evaluated at runtime and replaced by 
their values
These replacement field expressions may be followed by a format specifier introduced by a :
The parts of the f-string outside the curly braces will be treated as usual in string literals
 (except that double curly braces {{ or }} are replaced with the corresponding single curly brace)

See: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings and
 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals

Example -  Consider the following example, solved with and without an f-string:

>>> name = 'Mary'
>>> age = 37
>>> print(name + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old.')
Mary is 37 years old.

>>> print(f'{name} is {age} years old.')
Mary is 37 years old.
Note how the f-string avoids the need to concatenate the string and use the string constructor to
 convert the numeric variable to a string when printing

See: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings and https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals

You can control the formatting of the replacement field expressions by using a format specifier that 
dictates how the expression will be formatted

The format specifier can dictate a minimum width for the field so as you might want when creating
 columns in multi-line output

This width is specified immediately after the : that follows the expression

EXAMPLE: if you wanted a report with a column for first names and a column for last names, each 10 
characters wide, you might write:

print(f'{f_name:10} {l_name:10}')
