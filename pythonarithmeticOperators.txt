Arithmetic Operators

The expression 2 + 3 + 7 uses the arithmetic operator +

Other operators we may use in Python expressions are:

  -     the minus operator

  *    the multiplication operator

  /     the division operator

  //   another division operator (whatâ€™s the difference?

  %   the mod operator (remaindering operator)

  **  the exponentiation operator

Scripts Involving Arithmetic Expressions

Consider the screenshot shown below

Each expression typed leads to the result shown on the line below it
Note that 8 / 3 yields a result with the decimal part and 8 // 3 yields an integer result
Also, 8 / 2 yields 4.0 as opposed to 4 because of / as opposed to //
13 % 5 yields the remainder when 13 is divided by 5
2**3 calculates 23 (Exponentiation) [Python uses ^ for something else]
